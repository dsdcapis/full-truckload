# API Scopes

## Purpose

The `api-scopes` folder contains high-level scopes for APIs that will be created within this GitHub repository. Each scope document provides an overview of the API's purpose, functionality, and key features. These scopes serve as a reference for developers and stakeholders to understand the objectives and boundaries of each API project.

## Contents

- **API Scope Documents**: Each file in this folder represents the scope of a specific API. The documents outline the API's goals, endpoints, data models, and any other relevant information.
