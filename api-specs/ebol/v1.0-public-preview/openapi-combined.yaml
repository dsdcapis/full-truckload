    # Overview


    The NMFTA has partnered with leaders across the transportation industry to
    deliver a digitized

    method of transferring data between parties. By developing open-source API
    standards, the

    NMFTA and its partners will open the door to a more efficient method of data
    transfer, which

    today is still accomplished through a variety of more rudimentary processes.
    Digital API

    standards will reduce costs to onboard new business partners, improve
    visibility to shipment

    information, allow for real time notification on shipment changes, and drive
    out waste across

    the industry by eliminating manual processes. API standards will empower
    technological

    development, particularly when it comes to process automation.


    The Bill of Lading (BOL) is a crucial document that communicates the details
    and expectations

    for a specific freight shipment. It is a legally binding document issued by
    the Carrier to the

    Shipper that defines the shipment (type, quantity, origin, etc.), and is the
    basis of the business

    transaction between a Shipper and a Carrier. The current BOL process
    consists of a physical

    document transported between parties that is frequently lost, stolen, or
    delayed in being

    documented for all parties to review. This council will create an electronic
    Bill of Lading API

    standard that will allow for a more efficient and streamlined BOL process
    that will reduce or

    eliminate some of the risks associated with the current BOL process.


    Because the BOL sets the expectations for a shipment, it serves as the
    foundation for

    processes later in the shipment lifecycle. Similarly, the eBOL defined by
    the Digital Council will

    provide the foundation for the other APIs that will be defined to handle
    other business

    processes. An eBOL will act as a digital twin of a physical BOL document,
    containing the same

    crucial shipment information and carrying the same importance.


    # Value Proposition


    - **Shipper:** The eBOL API will allow a Shipper to more easily share the
    official details of a
      shipment, reducing opportunities for misunderstanding, human error, and theft. With
      existing BOL processes, particularly for a LTL shipment, a Shipper does not have
      visibility to the PRO number or shipment status until Pickup occurs. With the eBOL API,
      the Shipper will receive the PRO number pre-pickup, and in conjunction with other
      standard APIs, will be able to receive pre-pickup visibility on their loads.
      
      Additionally, current processes leave open the possibility for theft when bad actors
      manipulate physical BOL’s to hide evidence of theft, and makes it difficult for Shippers
      to prove otherwise. An electronic BOL process will reduce these opportunities and give
      Shipper’s peace of mind.

      A Shipper will initiate the eBOL process by sending the details of their shipment to a
      Carrier using the standard API format. They will receive back from the Carrier a
      completed BOL and shipping label. The response will also include a unique shipment
      identifier (PRO in the case of an LTL shipment) that can be used to reference the
      shipment in future interactions with the Carrier, including tracking update requests.

    - **Carrier:** The eBOL API will be especially beneficial to the Carrier
    community by
      outlining the standard communication protocol for sharing BOL information, greatly
      simplifying the connectivity required to do business with a large number of shippers,
      customers, and third parties. Among other things this will improve billing accuracy,
      reduce opportunity for manual errors, and allow Carriers to provide better service to
      customers.

      A Carrier will receive details of a shipment via the eBOL API from the Shipper, store the
      information in their system, and return the official BOL back to the Shipper. They will
      also return a shipping label that the Shipper can print and attach to their shipment. As
      part of this, they will also return a unique load identifier (in the case of an LTL shipment,
      it will be the PRO number) back to the Shipper that can be used to reference their load
      going forward.

    - **3rd Party:** The eBOL API will allow third parties of all kinds to
    receive and send the
      necessary shipment information to ensure a seamless flow through the life cycle of a
      shipment. Due to the nature of 3rd parties’ business and having to interact with multiple
      parties in the transportation industry, 3rd parties stand much to gain by simplification of
      their business processes, which the eBOL will enable.

    ## LTL


    In the LTL industry, the BOL is a particularly valuable document due to the
    inherent

    complexities of an LTL shipment. Not only does an LTL BOL contain general
    shipment

    information (such as origin, destination, billing info), but it also
    contains very detailed

    information on the freight being shipped, down to the commodity information
    of each

    individual line item. Because of this, any eBOL solution for an LTL shipment
    must be very

    detailed, while still allowing for significant variations from shipment to
    shipment.


    The NMFTA LTL Digital Council has already defined and released standards for
    eBOL in the LTL

    industry. Its usage is being adopted by Shippers, Carriers, and 3PLs, and is
    being put to use to

    drive efficiency and automation for LTL shipments.


    ## FTL


    The BOL for a Full Truckload shipment serves the same purpose and contains
    similar

    information to that of an LTL shipment. The main difference between a FTL
    and LTL is the level

    of detail is usually less for a FTL shipment. A FTL BOL may not include a
    PRO number, NMFC

    Codes, Classification, and often will not include pallet counts and reliable
    dimensions.

    The NMFTA FTL Digital Council will be coordinating with their LTL Council
    counterparts to look

    to find an opportunity for a single, combined eBOL standard that meets the
    needs of both the

    LTL and FTL use cases. The synergy between the two will help drive adoption
    throughout the

    transportation industry, where many organizations are involved in both FTL
    and LTL

    transportation.

        ## Request


        As a Shipper/3rd Party, I want to Create/Update/Delete an Electronic
        Bill of Lading and send shipment

        information for a particular shipment to a Carrier.


        - In a request, the Shipper/3rd Party MUST identify themselves so the
        Carrier is aware of

        who is sending the BOL information
          - Types of Roles: Shipper, Third Party, Consignee
        - In a request, the Shipper/3rd Party MUST provide a requested pickup
        date. The

        requested pickup date MUST be in date/time format. The API will allow
        for a Pickup

        Begin and Pickup End date/time.
          - LTL Consideration: The requested pickup date is NOT a formal LTL Pickup
        Request

        - In a request, the Shipper/3rd Party MUST designate the origin and
        destination for the

        shipment. This can be via a location id understood by both parties, or
        via the address of

        the location.

        - In a request, the Shipper/3rd Party MAY designate whether or not they
        want an image of

        the BOL and/or Shipping Labels returned in the response.

        - In a request, the Shipper/3rd Party MAY designate a reference number
        associated with

        their shipment.

        - In a request, the Shipper/3rd Party MUST specify freight Billing terms
        for the shipment.

        - In a request, the Shipper/3rd Party MUST specify the Billing
        information for the shipment,

        including name, address, and contact information.

        - In a request, a Shipper/3rd Party MAY provide special shipment
        requirements that would

        indicate if accessorials are needed.
          - Examples Include, but not limited to:
            - Limited Access
            - Time Critical
            - Lift Gate Required
            - Expedite
        - In a request, the Shipper/3rd Party MUST specify the commodity of the
        freight being

        shipped.
          - LTL Consideration: The classification of LTL commodities MUST be included for
        an LTL shipment

        - In a request, additional details on the shipment MAY be included. The
        API will allow for

        information to be provided at both the commodity level, as well as at
        the total shipment

        level.
          - LTL Consideration: The weight, handling units, and dimensions of an LTL
        shipment MUST be included
          - Examples include:
            - Weight
            - Handling Units
            - Linear Length
            - Overall Dimensions
        - Shipper/3rd Party SHOULD provide details for a HAZMAT shipment. This
        information

        with be conditionally required based on U.S. Department of
        Transportation's (DOT)

        Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR Parts 171-180). This includes:
          - Hazardous Description
          - Total Quantity
            - Weight or Volume (i.e. lbs, kilograms, liters, etc.)
          - Hazard class or Division
          - Identification Number (UN/NA)
          - Proper Name
          - Technical Name
          - Packaging Group
          - Emergency Response
            - 24-Hour Emergency Response
            - Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) Guide Number
          - Marine Pollutant Marking
          - Contact Number
        - Shipper/3rd Party SHOULD provide Total Shipment Value in a designated
        currency (USD

        as an option) for high value shipments that may require additional
        considerations by the

        Carrier.


        ## Response


        As a Carrier, I want to respond to the Shipper/3rd Party who created the
        electronic Bill of Lading

        and either accept or reject, as well as provide a unique shipment
        identifier associated with the

        shipment.


        - In a response, the Carrier must indicate if the eBOL was successfully
        accepted
          - Reasons an eBOL request would be rejected:
            - Not enough information provided in eBOL request
            - Internal error in Carrier system (example: PRO number Shipper sent
            already associated with a different shipment)
        - In a response, the Carrier MUST provide the timestamp of the
        transaction date for the

        electronic bill of lading.

        - In a response, the Carrier MUST designate a reference number to
        uniquely identify the

        shipment, if one was not provided in the request.
          - If a reference number was provided in the request, then it MUST be provided in
          the response.
          - Reference Best Practices for list of available reference number types.
        - The Carrier MUST provide BOL details in the response, and MUST provide
        a PDF image

        of the BOL and Shipping labels if requested in the Request body.
