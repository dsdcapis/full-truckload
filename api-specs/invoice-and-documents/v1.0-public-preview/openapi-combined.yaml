    # Overview


    NMFTA is on a journey with logistical and banking institutions to transform
    the electronic transfer of invoice data and supporting documents through an
    open-source API. Systems across the economic landscape will leverage this
    information to bring speed through data availability. Today, EDI and digital
    document uploads across numerous company specific applications are required
    for doing business within the logistical sector. Ultimately, this work will
    include managing a corpus of electronic data values and document file type
    returns with the focus on the transfer of the Invoice and supporting
    documents supporting all logistical types.


    Part of the journey is to build an open API to ensure all logistical and
    banking partners to reach a level of automation that scales with the
    business demand. With adoption of the FTL council, medium- and long-term
    value will be achieved for all parties across the economic markets and
    transportation providers. Teams from DSDC (Digital Standards Development
    Council) and support from the LTL council have come together for a
    collective goal to achieve business value for all.


    **The GAP:** Multiple sources and various technology implementations have
    created an endless landscape for shippers, carriers, and banking
    institutions that continue to empower antiquated physical documentation or
    outgrown EDI processes. APIs do not currently have all consistent components
    to fully operationalize document data transfers and document type
    dissemination, especially in the areas of "invoice data values", "bill of
    lading" and "freight bills"


    **Value Proposition:** The Invoice and Documents API will allow for the
    ability to seamlessly pass specific invoice and related shipment information
    regardless of transport type to obtain or pass an invoice or related
    documentation. This will transform the logistics industry by simplification
    of complex billing processes through accuracy and timeliness in one place
    will be paramount for all shipments. With a design to handle all
    complexities for any shipment, a simplified standard source will meet all
    business needs quickly while providing companies with the needed forecasting
    for growth.


    - **Carriers:** Providing the ability to pass and create an invoice through
    details to a Shipper or 3rd Party through standard shipment details.
    Additional documentation will also be able to be passed for additional proof
    of payment through supporting document types through shipment criteria. The
    ease will allow for Carriers to ensure that they avoid being cornered within
    the market.

    - **Shippers:** Receiving Carrier invoices and supplemental documentation
    for payment will allow for central standard empowering timely and accurate
    validation of services while providing the ability to eliminate slower
    physical or open-source transfers.

    - **3rd Party:** Ensuring no delay in data validation or accuracy in
    supplying the appropriate information to support Invoice and supporting
    documentation for all parties
